<div style="text-align: justify"> Hello, my name is Pilar Dib. I hold a Bachelor's Degree in Chemical Engineering, awarded by the Pontifical Catholic University of Campinas (PUC-Campinas) in 2018. Following my graduation, I embarked on a doctoral journey in Bioenergy at the State University of Campinas (UNICAMP), immersing myself for four years in programming and process simulation, advanced research methodologies and analytical skills. </div>
